			<br/> Hi my name is Abigail Castaneda but I prefer to be called Abi. I live with my parents and I have 3 siblings. I have an older brother, a younger sister, and a younger brother. Something funny about my parents is they gave us all names that start with an A. Growing up in my household was really tough, fun, strict, happy and most importantly full of unconditional love. I always thank God for giving me a great family that can support me in my rollercoaster life because it is always going to be hard to find a place you can call home. Home is a place where you are full of honest, trustworthy, supportful, strong, loyal, and loving people. My favorite type of music is hip hop, rap, mexican music and other type of music that makes me feel in the mood. Currently my favorite music is Money In The Grave and Nunca Es Suficiente Para Mi. My favorite type of movies is everything that make me feel deep feeling but I don't like scary movies because I just don't. My favorite basketball team is Golden State Warriors. My favorite football team is Dallas Cowboys, I feel like my uncle was the one that really got me hooked up in that team.
