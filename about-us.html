			<br/> Hi my name is Abigail Castaneda but I prefer to be called Abi. I live with my parents and I have 3 siblings. I have an older brother, a younger sister, and a younger brother. Something funny about my parents is they gave us all names that start with an A. Growing up in my household is really tough, fun, strict, happy and most importantly full of unconditional love. I always thank God for giving me a great family that can support me in my rollercoaster life because it's always going to be hard to find a place you can call home. Home is a place where you are full of honest, trustworthy, supportful, strong, loyal, loving, and non judgmental people. My favorite type of music is hip hop, rap, mexican music and other type of music that makes me feel in the mood. Currently my favorite music is Money In The Grave and Nunca Es Suficiente Para Mi. My favorite movie genre is anything that evokes deep feelings such as inspiration or a full belly laugh. However, I don't like scary movies because the movie can feel too realistic such as witches, g. My favorite basketball team is Golden State Warriors. My favorite football team is Dallas Cowboys, I feel like my uncle was the one that really got me hooked up in that team. I also like soccer but I don't really have a favorite team. Although if someone asks me the question between Chivas vs America, I choose America. My favorite shows are All American, The Flash, Arrow, Criminal Minds, and Masterchef (go watch, best shows ever). Some of my hobbies are drawing (to be honest any type of art), sports, yoga, martial arts, reading, and hearing music.
